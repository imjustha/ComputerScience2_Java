/*
One lap around a standard high-school running track is exactly 0.25 miles. Define a method named lapsToMiles that takes a double as a parameter, representing the number of laps, and returns a double that represents the number of miles. Then, write a main program that takes a number of laps as an input, calls method lapsToMiles() to calculate the number of miles, and outputs the number of miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
System.out.printf("%.2f\n", yourValue);

Ex: If the input is:

7.6
the output is:

1.90
Ex: If the input is:

2.2
the output is:

0.55
The program must define and call a method:
public static double lapsToMiles(double userLaps)
 */
public class TrackLapsToMiles {
    /* Define your method here */

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Type your code here. Your code must call the method.  */
    }
}
