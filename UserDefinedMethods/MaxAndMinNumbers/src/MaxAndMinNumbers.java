/*
Write a program whose inputs are four integers, and whose outputs are the maximum and the minimum of the four values.

Ex: If the input is:

12 18 4 9
the output is:

Maximum is 18
Minimum is 4
The program must define and call the following two methods. Define a method named maxNumber that takes four integer parameters and returns an integer representing the maximum of the four integers. Define a method named minNumber that takes four integer parameters and returns an integer representing the minimum of the four integers.
public static int maxNumber(int num1, int num2, int num3, int num4)
public static int minNumber(int num1, int num2, int num3, int num4)
 */
public class MaxAndMinNumbers {
    /* Define your method here */

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Type your code here. */
    }
}
