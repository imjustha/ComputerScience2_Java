/*
Write a program that takes in a positive integer as input, and outputs a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in binary. For an integer x, the algorithm is:

As long as x is greater than 0
   Output x % 2 (remainder is either 0 or 1)
   x = x / 2
Note: The above algorithm outputs the 0's and 1's in reverse order. You will need to write a second function to reverse the string.

Ex: If the input is:

6
the output is:

110
The program must define and call the following two methods. Define a method named intToReverseBinary() that takes an int as a parameter and returns a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in binary (in reverse). Define a method named stringReverse() that takes a string as a parameter and returns a string representing the input string in reverse.

public static String intToReverseBinary(int integerValue)
public static String stringReverse(String inputString)


 */
public class ConvertToBinary {
    /* Define your methods here */

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* Type your code here.
         Your code must call intToReverseBinary() to get
         the binary string of an integer in a reverse order.
         Then call stringReverse() to reverse the string
         returned from intToReverseBinary().*/
