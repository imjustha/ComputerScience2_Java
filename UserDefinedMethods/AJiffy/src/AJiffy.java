/*
In computer animation, a "jiffy" is commonly defined as 1/100th of a second. Define a method named jiffiesToSeconds that takes a float as a parameter, representing the number of "jiffies", and returns a float that represents the number of seconds. Then, write a main program that reads the number of jiffies as an input, calls method jiffiesToSeconds() with the input as argument, and outputs the number of seconds.

Output each floating-point value with three digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
System.out.printf("%.3f\n", yourValue);

Ex: If the input is:

15.25
the output is:

0.153
The program must define and call a method:
public static double jiffiesToSeconds(double userJiffie)
 */
public class AJiffy {
    /* Define your method here */

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Type your code here. */
    }
}
