/*
Write a program that reads a list of integers, and outputs whether the list contains all multiples of 10, no multiples of 10, or mixed values. Define a method named isArrayMult10 that takes an array as a parameter, representing the list, and an integer as a parameter, representing the size of the list. isArrayMult10() returns a boolean that represents whether the list contains all multiples of ten. Define a method named isArrayNoMult10 that takes an array as a parameter, representing the list, and an integer as a parameter, representing the size of the list. isArrayNoMult10() returns a boolean that represents whether the list contains no multiples of ten.

Then, write a main program that takes an integer, representing the size of the list, followed by the list values. The first integer is not in the list. Assume that the list will always contain less than 20 integers.

Ex: If the input is:

5 20 40 60 80 100
the output is:

all multiples of 10
Ex: If the input is:

5 11 -32 53 -74 95
the output is:

no multiples of 10
Ex: If the input is:

5 10 25 30 40 55
the output is:

mixed values
The program must define and call the following two methods. isArrayMult10() returns true if all integers in the array are multiples of ten and false otherwise. isArrayNoMult10() returns true if no integers in the array are multiples of ten and false otherwise.
public static boolean isArrayMult10(int[] arrayValues, int arraySize)
public static boolean isArrayNoMult10(int[] arrayValues, int arraySize)
