/*
This program will output a right triangle based on user specified height triangleHeight and symbol triangleChar.

(1) The given program outputs a fixed-height triangle using a * character. Modify the given program to output a right triangle that instead uses the user-specified triangleChar character. (1 pt)



(2) Modify the program to use a nested loop to output a right triangle of height triangleHeight. The first line will have one user-specified character, such as % or *. Each subsequent line will have one additional user-specified character until the number in the triangle's base reaches triangleHeight. Output a space after each user-specified character, including after the line's last user-specified character. (2 pts)



Example output for triangleChar = % and triangleHeight = 5:

Enter a character:
%
Enter triangle height:
5

%
% %
% % %
% % % %
% % % % %
