/*
The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640410470001730089

Calories = ((Age * 0.2757) + (Weight * 0.03295) + (HeartRate * 1.0781) - 75.4991) * Time) / 8.368

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
System.out.printf("%.2f", yourValue);
Ex: If the input is:

49 155 148 60

the output is:

Calories: 736.21 calories
